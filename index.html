            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a small-town girl who grew up in Alaminos, Laguna in a middle-income family. My father is a retired assistant manager at a bank, and my mother was an agriculturist-turned-OFW. Through hard work and a bit of luck, I now run my own IT company of 60 people, serving clients locally and abroad for software development.</p>
